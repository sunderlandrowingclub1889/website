      p There is an expectation that if you want to perform well, you need to train well. Training is built around weekend mornings and mid-week evenings on the water. There is flexibility within the programme for real life for those who need it and can be arranged with the Captain and coaches.. 

      p Our training is supported by our successful and committed coaching team and a good fleet of both small and big boats.
