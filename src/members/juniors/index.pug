      h1 A great way to have fun and keep fit!
      p Our junior squad is for anyone aged between 10 and 18, our current squad is made up of 40 members. The club aims to introduce rowing to young people both competitvely and socially.  We compete in local and regional regattas and head races. 

      p We offer taster days for juniors during the school holidays about 3 or 4 times per year. These days give the potential rower a chance to have a go at all aspects of rowing (indoor rowing, circuit training as well as getting out on to the water) to see whether it is a sport they may enjoy. The days are good fun and open to all.

      p If you would like to be kept informed of the date of our next taster day, please send a request by email.
