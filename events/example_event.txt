This is an example event used to show how to make new events.

The date must be formatted in the same way as the example date. The month is the three-letter abbreviation of the month name, for example: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, and so on. The comma between the date and the year is also important, as are all of the spaces.

The time must be in 24 hour format. 02:30 pm should be 14:30.

The name of the event shows up on the calendar, so keep it short, there's not much space for each date.

The image the path to an image in the images/events/ folder, relative to that folder and without a file extension. For example, if the path to your image is images/events/examples/my_image.png, then the path in this file should be examples/my_image

The colour is the colour for the notch in the event calendar and can be any of the colours specified in the includes/event_colours.styl file. You can add more colours to this file to allow the use of more colours in events. It is also possible for events to use a custom colour that isn't in the event_colours.styl file by putting 'custom, ' before any valid CSS colour value, for example: custom, rgb(200, 39, 153)

Everything after the three dashes (---) is the description, which can be multiple lines and can have as much information in it as needed. It shows up when you click on a date with the event in the calendar.
