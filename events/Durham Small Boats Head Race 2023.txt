This is one of the most popular head races in the north. The Head takes place every year on the first weekend of February and regularly attracts around 400 entries spread over 4 divisions. This makes it an ideal event for clubs to try out various combinations of crews throughout the day. The course covers an 1800m stretch of the River Wear and requires a competent cox to navigate through the arches of Elvet Bridge.
